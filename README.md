## Abstact
The project aims to eradicate or to get rid of solid waste, especially Electronic waste (E-waste), replacing the conventional method of segregation and eradicating all the ill-effects which India currently uses for E-WASTE management. New automated ways using AI&ML with minimum human involvement are the major USP of the project.
