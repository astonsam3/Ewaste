INTRODUCTION

The project aims to eradicate or get rid of solid waste, especially Electronic waste (E-waste). E-Waste is becoming a significant threat worldwide. The electrical and electronics industries have experienced enormous growth in the last few decades. The increasing collection of E-waste from retail customers or from Industries in bulk and transporting it to a Recycling Plant and Recycling all with present outdated procedures is not an easier task even for huge organizations. This E-waste releases toxic emissions mixed with virgin soil and air and causes harmful effects to the entire biodiversity directly or indirectly. Direct impacts include the release of acids, toxic components including heavy metals, and carcinogenic chemicals. Hence, the Management and Recycling of E-waste have become an increasingly important environmental issue. So, our Idea is to improve the quality of the recycling process by automating it with the help of the latest technologies like Artificial Intelligence & Machine learning. It may sound ironic, but technology is the answer to the e-waste crisis. Disassembling and recycling electronics by hand is dangerous and time-consuming. With AI, ML, and robotics, though, electronics can be recycled rapidly and invaluable parts salvaged for reuse. Applying AI and ML to the e-waste crisis could save electronics manufacturers billions of dollars and end e-waste pollution.

 Objectives

The objective of this project is to design and implement a E-Waste Management (SWM) system for cities that leverages various AI models, both single and hybrid, to optimize the generation, detection, collection, classification, and properties of E-Waste . The project aims to achieve the following goals. Prediction and optimization: Utilize AI techniques to accurately predict and optimize the generation, composition, and quantity of E-waste in cities.  Automated detection and classification by utilizing computer vision and machine learning algorithms, the objective is to accurately identify and classify various E-waste items. This will enable efficient sorting and recycling processes, reducing the reliance on manual sorting and enhancing recycling rates. Build a decision support system that integrates the outputs of various AI models and provides actionable insights.
